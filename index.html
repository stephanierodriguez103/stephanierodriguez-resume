        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am double majoring in Liberal Studies and Education. I have been involved with clubs on campus including: Poder and ASUCR. For PODER, I participate in events that bring awareness to the undocumented community. As an undocumented student it is important for me to share the issues that face my community even if it is not directly involving me. For example, the deportation of many innocent people which leads to the seperation of family is one of the main issues I tend to focus on. This is because although it is not directly a friend or family member who is being deported, the possibility of it occuring to me is very high. Therefore, if I see it happening to others, I can put myself in their situation and feel for them and want to help stop the pain their family goes through in the process of deportation. For ASUCR, I represented UCR, as well as about 30 others, in Pasadena and Merced to discuss what the campus can do in order to help minorities such as undocumented students, people of color, and those with disabilities. In Pasadena, our main focus was building more inclusive and safe spaces for undocumented students to gather to seek legal help or to talk if the anxiety of deportation becomes unbearable. In Merced, we focused on the unfair treatment and payment of garment workers. During this discussion we also participated in a peaceful protest around the UC Merced campus, reaching out to their chancellor to improve worker's wages.<br><br>

        In high school, I was involved with DREAMers. This club was also to support and spread information about undocumented students and community members. We held conferences every week for any legal updates or guest speakers who have helped the community. In DREAMers, we have also held a press conference in front of the school which aired on television and we have done toy drives to donate to our local elementary school.I was also involved in Global Ambasssadors in high school. This club held many activities including: incorporating water stations around the campus, making care packages for veterans and people currently deployed, care and makeup packages for homeless and foster care, and built a garden to encourage healthy eating habits. We also cleaned up around the school and held events to share informational or historical films in order to fundraise for the care packages and garden tools.<br><br>

        I am a well organized student, I use a planner to keep track of due dates and like to get assignments done as soon as I can. I have used resources in UCR such as the academic resource center in order to manage my time more effectively which has helped tremendously. Since I commute to school, by taking two buses to get there and two buses to get home, managing my time is essential because I get car sick and therefore, unable to complete anything on the bus. I am also a very prompt person who constantly tries to find any effective ways of completing tasks at the best of my abilities. I seek several solutions to any problems that may arise in any case and try them all for tedious solutions. I am a people-person and can work independently and with a group.
